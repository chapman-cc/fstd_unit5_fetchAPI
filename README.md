# Javascript Fetch API  
### Project 5 from TeamTreehouse FSTD 

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.

For this project, you'll build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.
